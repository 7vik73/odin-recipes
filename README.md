# odin-recipes

This Project is about building a recipe page and getting hands-on experience on writing html code instead of just watching tutorials.

After completing this project I cna say I am able to use HTML components to get a basic general structure and also with HTML Boilerplate 

I create the website with general Heading and Unordered List Representations that you can see in the commit history and I include Images and Links b/w the recipe pages and Home index file.
